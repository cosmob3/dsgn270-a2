### Hero Section Critique 

**Website Summary**
- The targeted audience for rentfaster.ca is adults looking for housing. The website makes it easy for people to search for rental properties by city, price range, type, number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

**Call-to-Action Critique**
- I believe the call to action is pretty effective. Most people browsing this website would likely be looking to rent or list their property to be rented. 
- The two buttons that are there to preform the action of listing a property or searching properties are both in a similar style, which draws the eyes in and makes it easier to find whatever you are looking for. 
- In terms of the colours and the contrast, the website looks really good. The orange, grey, and light blue colours that they have chosen mix really well and are soothing. Kind of like home! 
- Sizing and scaling is also done very well. There is not much text on the home page. One of the bigger areas is the area to search for properties. This takes visual hierarchy as one's eyes are rather quickly drawn to it.  It even has drop down menus to allow for easier use. 
- The home page displays different images as you refresh the page. But they all have the theme of home life or family. Once again bringing up that soothinng feeling. 
- The display and text typefaces are relatively similar but the make the website easy to read and they work well with each other.
